These files contain sample data with ground truth for escalator and elevator use.
The devices used to collect these data are:
* Samsung Galaxy S5 Active
* Microsoft Band 2

Data were collected and stored in Apache Avro format. The data have also been translated to CSV format. The raw traces for the entire data collection trial are in archives avro-raw.zip and csv-raw.zip. The CSV data have been further post-processed to organize subsets of data in sub-folders corresponding to particular interval labels (e.g., riding escalator from time t1 to t2). The label-specific sub-folders are in csv-segments.zip.

Avro Schema for data from sensors used are in avro-schema-5-17.zip
